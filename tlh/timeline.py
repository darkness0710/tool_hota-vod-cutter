"""Turn the signal into YouTube chapters for the cut video.

Chapters are anchored on three things read out of the frame:

* the "Month: M, Week: W, Day: D" counter, which is trusted only where a value
  holds for several samples AND follows legally from the one before it;
* game boundaries -- the counter resetting to day 1, which is what a restart
  looks like;
* hero-vs-hero battles, which show a "Spell Points" panel on BOTH sides. One
  panel means a fight against neutral guards and is not marked.

Two details this has to get right or the output is unusable. Times are on the
CUT timeline, not the source: a chapter pointing into removed footage is worse
than no chapter. And YouTube rejects a chapter list whose entries are less than
ten seconds apart, so anything closer is folded into the one before it.
