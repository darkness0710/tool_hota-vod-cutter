"""Encode each kept segment with its transition, then join them.

Each segment is encoded separately with a fade in, a fade out, and 0.4 s of
black appended by `tpad`/`apad`. Baking the black hold into the segment itself
means every file in the concat list comes out of the same encoder with the same
parameters, so the final join is a stream copy and cannot drift.

Cutting per segment is also faster than one filter pass over the whole VOD: a
segment only decodes its own range instead of the entire file.

Audio is faded alongside the video. Without `afade` every join pops, because
the cut lands mid-sentence in the streamer's commentary.
