# per game rather than assumed once.
#
# Each slot spans its WHOLE half of the HUD, the two meeting at the frame
# centre, rather than sitting tight around where one VOD happened to draw the
# plate. What moves between streams is how far the plates sit from the centre
# title, and that is exactly the direction a tight window has no slack in:
# measured at scale 1.00 and y 12..36 in both VODs to hand, the plate lands at
# x 712..832 / 1059..1179 in [sd9BBehBBTY] against 1112..1232 in the VOD the
# template was cut from. The old right slot began at 1100, forty-one pixels
# past the start of the plate, so m_right topped out at 0.385 over every one of
# 3473 samples -- under NAME_MATCH, so no frame ever named the right seat, the
# whole first hour was backfilled with a later game's left seat, and both
# clocks were attributed to the wrong player. Meeting at the centre keeps the
# slots disjoint, so which slot matched still IS the seat, and leaves ~48 px of
# slack outboard and ~130 px inboard of every plate seen so far.

                    # leaves bins untouched. On the same stretch the frozen clock
