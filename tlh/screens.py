"""Passes 2 and 3: recognise screens where nothing is being played.

The clocks alone cannot answer two questions:

* Whether a stretch with no clock overlay is real play or a lobby/menu. HotA
  hides the overlay during combat, town and hero screens and some dialogs, and
  some games are played with no timer at all -- so "no clock" is not idle time.
* Whether a stretch with BOTH clocks frozen is Tieulinh's own battle or
  Tieulinh waiting while the opponent fights. Combat freezes both clocks either
  way.

The first is settled by template-matching the handful of dead screens; the
second by the bottom bar, which is the blue resource strip on the adventure map
and a wooden status bar in combat.

Both passes only ever look at the candidate stretches pass 1 flagged, not the
whole video.
