"""A local web page that runs the pipeline and shows where each job is.

    python -m tlh.web            then open http://127.0.0.1:8765
    web.cmd                      the same, and opens the browser

Why this exists: the console tells you what is happening only while its window
is open. Close it and there is no way left to ask "has that link finished
downloading", which is the first thing anyone who is not the author wants to
know. So every job gets a record under work/jobs/ that outlives the window.

Three deliberate choices:

* **Standard library only.** No FastAPI, no uvicorn, nothing to pip install.
  A web page is not worth another dependency that can fail to install on a
  machine where the point was to avoid installing things.

* **Nothing in the pipeline changed.** This spawns `run.py` as a subprocess
  and reads its output, rather than reaching inside it. The pipeline works;
  a new interface should not be able to break it. The cost is that this parses
  our own console output -- see PATTERNS -- so a change to a progress line
  shows up here as a stage without a percentage rather than as a crash. Jobs
  started from Start.cmd are also invisible to this page.

* **127.0.0.1 only.** This endpoint starts processes. It must not be reachable
  from the network, so it never binds 0.0.0.0.
