"""Pass 1: everything that can be read from one decode of the video.

Per sample it produces:

* whether each H2H clock's digits moved since the last sample -- a running
  clock means that player is on the move, a frozen one means they are not;
* which name slot holds "Tieulinh HOTA", which fixes the colour, because the
  HUD always seats the red player left and the blue player right;
* the "Month: M, Week: W, Day: D" counter;
* whether a hero panel with "Spell Points" is showing on each side -- two of
  them means a hero-vs-hero battle, one means a fight against neutrals.
