# tieu_linh_hota

**Author:** Nguyễn Thanh Hải

Trims a Tieulinh HOTA stream VOD down to the parts that are actually being
played, joins the pieces with a fade to black, and writes a YouTube chapter list
naming the in-game day. On the reference VOD (2:48:19) that leaves
**1:50:17 (65.5%)**, removes **58:02** of dead time, and produces **56
chapters**.

## Click these

| | |
|---|---|
| **`Install.cmd`** | once, when setting up. No administrator rights needed |
| **`Start.cmd`** | every time: asks for a URL or uses `input/`, cuts, writes `output/` |
| **`debug.cmd`** | one file, analysis only or pieces only — for testing the detector |
| **`web.cmd`** | a local page: paste a link, see which stage each job is in |
| **`Clear.cmd`** | free disk space, with confirmation, via the Recycle Bin |

Everything else is machinery; nothing needs editing by hand except
`tlh/config.py`.

`Start.cmd` offers two routes — download a link, or use what is already in
`input/`. With several videos it lists them numbered and asks which: one,
`1,3`, or `all`. It never starts on a whole folder unasked, because each video
costs most of an hour.

### debug.cmd has two speeds

| | what runs | on a 30 min clip |
|---|---|---|
| `debug.cmd` | analysis, then one mp4 per kept stretch into `work/<name>/parts/`, **not joined** | ~7 min |
| `debug.cmd -NoRender` | analysis only: `segments.csv`, `segments.json`, `chapters.txt` | ~2.4 min |

Add `-Reanalyse` to decode the video again instead of reusing
`work/<name>/signal.npz`. Both modes take one file, never the folder, and
neither writes anything to `output/`.

### web.cmd, for whoever is not reading a console

Opens `http://127.0.0.1:8765`. Paste a link and start it, watch the stage and
percentage of every job, re-run a file from `input/`, see what is left on the
drive. Job records live in `work/jobs/` and survive the window closing, which
is the one question a console cannot answer afterwards: *has it finished?*

Leave the black window open — the jobs are its child processes. Jobs started
from `Start.cmd` do not appear on the page. Details in
[documents/web.md](documents/web.md).

## Commands

```
python run.py                           # everything in input/ -> output/
python run.py --url https://youtu.be/X  # download into input/, then cut it
python run.py --urls links.txt          # a list of URLs, one per line
python run.py --file "exact name.mp4"   # exactly this file (repeatable)
python run.py --only "match1*.mp4"      # files matching a glob (repeatable)
python run.py -i D:\vods -o D:\cut      # different folders
```

| option | |
|---|---|
| `--dry-run` | analyse and write the segment list, no render |
| `--parts-only` | render the pieces into `work/<name>/parts`, do not join them |
| `--per-game` | one video per game, `[DD-MM-YYYY] Opponent (game N).mp4`, instead of one for the whole stream |
| `--keep-parts` | join them, but keep the pieces too |
| `--force` | re-render even if the output already exists |
| `--reanalyse` | ignore the cached signal and decode again |
| `--live-progress` | one redrawing download progress line instead of many |
| `--workers N` | parallel decoders for the analysis (default 4) |
| `--render-workers N` | parallel hardware encoders (default 3) |

Use `--file`, not `--only`, for a downloaded name: those contain `[brackets]`,
which a glob reads as a character class matching nothing.

A file whose output already exists is skipped, so an interrupted batch can just
be restarted. A file that fails is reported and the batch carries on.

## Names

Everything is named after the day the stream happened, and the date leads the
filename at both ends so it travels with the file:

```
input/[23-08-2026] Live ngan mai off Elephant 1y [U197AGXIO3s].mp4
  ->  output/[23-08-2026] Stream.mp4
      output/[23-08-2026] Stream.txt      <- chapters, paste into the description
```

A second stream from the same day becomes `[23-08-2026] Stream (2).mp4`. The
date is read, in order, from the `[DD-MM-YYYY]` on the front of the input
filename, then the download record in `work/index.json`, and only failing both
from the file's timestamp, with a warning.

Downloads take the source's own resolution, preferring VP9 over AV1 at the
same size because it decodes faster. Every overlay coordinate is measured in a
1920x1080 reference frame, and any 16:9 source is scaled to it for detection
only — the render never rescales, so a 1440p VOD comes out 1440p. Anything not
16:9 is refused rather than squashed.

The cut keeps the source's frame rate. It used to force 60, which on this
channel's 30 fps VODs duplicated every frame: a bigger file, no extra motion.
