# Downloading

`Start.cmd` route 1 asks yt-dlp for the source's own resolution plus AAC
audio, sorted by size first and then by decode cost.

Codec is the part that matters. This channel publishes no H.264 above 1080p, so
asking for the original 1440p means taking VP9 or AV1 — and the analysis pass
decodes every frame of it. Measured over the same footage: **29x realtime on
H.264 1080p against 7x on VP9 1440p**, with AV1 slower again. `FORMAT_SORT`
therefore names vp9 ahead of yt-dlp's own default, which prefers av01.

The size is no longer a requirement. Any 16:9 source is scaled to the reference
frame for detection, so a 720p or 1440p file cuts correctly; only the aspect
ratio is refused.

Two external programs make this fast, and `Install.cmd` installs both per-user
with no administrator rights. Neither is required: without them the download
still works, just slowly.

| | why | without it |
|---|---|---|
| **deno** | yt-dlp runs YouTube's own JavaScript with it, to solve the `n` parameter of a stream URL | ~165 KB/s |
| **aria2c** | holds several connections open for one download | ~1 MB/s |

## The n parameter

Without a JavaScript runtime, yt-dlp cannot solve `n`, falls back to a player
client whose URLs carry no solved value, and googlevideo answers with about
10 MiB per request and then stalls for the best part of a minute. Measured on a
6.16 GiB VOD: **165 KB/s against 11 MiB/s** — ten hours instead of ten minutes.
Nothing errors. The download simply runs fifty times slower.

deno is the runtime to install: yt-dlp enables only deno by default, only deno
and bun have a solver script vendored inside yt-dlp, and node is rejected below
v22. `tlh/jsruntime.py` finds it.

## One connection is capped

googlevideo serves a single connection at about **1 MiB/s** — roughly twice
playback rate, and dead steady, so it is a cap rather than congestion. The cap
is per connection: measured with plain range requests on the same line,

| connections | throughput |
|---|---|
| 1 | 0.97 MiB/s |
| 8 | 7.67 MiB/s |
| 16 | 11.5 MiB/s (the line itself) |

A progressive URL cannot be split, so there are two ways to hold more than one
slot, and `tlh/fetch.py` prefers the first:

1. **aria2c** opens `ARIA2_CONNECTIONS` connections once and keeps them, each
   streaming a large contiguous range: eight for the whole download.
2. **yt-dlp's fragment pool** (`formats=dashy`) asks the extractor for the
   DASH-shaped view of the same stream, whose fragments are range requests, and
   fetches `PARALLEL` of them at a time. It works — and opens a new connection
   per 10 MiB fragment, about 600 for one VOD.

That churn is why aria2c is preferred. After a quarter of an hour of roughly a
connection a second, a home line stopped answering new ones: `[WinError 10060]
A connection attempt failed`, SYNs unanswered rather than refused, which is
what a CGNAT session limit or an anti-abuse filter looks like. Measured
mid-download, four fragment workers managed 0.50 MiB/s between them while a
brand new connection got 0.96 on its own — the fleet was sitting in connect
timeouts. `PARALLEL` is 4 for that reason, and `socket_timeout` is 15 s so a
stuck worker recovers in half the time.

Sixteen connections is not the answer on such a line: aria2c opened all
sixteen and transferred nothing at all, the same wall reached from the other
side.

## Video and audio are separate downloads

YouTube keeps them apart, so one VOD is two downloads and the header says so:

```
  Size        6.16 GiB
  Streams     video 299.mp4 5.97 GiB, then audio 140.m4a 194 MiB
```

googlevideo paces each stream at about twice **its own** bitrate, so the audio
is not slower in any meaningful sense — it has 31x less data and gets 31x less
bandwidth, and both streams take the same wall-clock time. Measured: video
4071 kbps at 7.51 MiB/s in 13:33, audio 129 kbps at 244 KiB/s in 13:20. The
consequence is that **half the download time goes on 3% of the bytes**, and
that picking a lower-bitrate audio format saves nothing: it would be paced
proportionally slower and take just as long.

## Interrupted downloads

Leftovers in `input/` are what a resume picks up from, and each downloader
leaves its own kind: `.part`, `.ytdl`, `.part-FragNN` (fragment pool) and
`.part.aria2` (aria2c's control file). `fetch.is_partial()` knows all of them
— it has to, because `already_have()` would otherwise hand a 10 MiB fragment
back as a finished video and the pipeline would sit down to cut it.

One leftover carries no marker at all: `NAME.f299.mp4`, one half of the pair
downloaded whole and waiting for the other. It ends in `.mp4`, so before it
was added to `is_partial()` all three readers of `input/` took it for a
finished video — `already_have()` returned it and the audio was never
fetched again, `run.py` cut it, and the web page offered it with a Run button.
Measured on the leftovers of a real failure: 7.33 GiB of silent video, called
finished by all three.

A failed URL does not fall back on the library either. `run.py` given `--url`
processes what it downloaded and nothing else, including when that is nothing:
otherwise a link dying at 87% starts an hour of work on whatever happens to be
sitting in `input/`.

Resume does not cross a change of downloader: aria2c cannot continue a
fragment-pool `.part`, and starts that stream again.

## The route going away

A download is restarted `fetch.ATTEMPTS` times, thirty seconds apart, before
it is called a failure. Measured: an audio stream an hour in died with all
eight of its connections reporting `unreachable host` in the same second,
which is a route that went away rather than a server saying no — aria2c's own
`--max-tries` cannot help with that, and it says as much on the way out:
*aria2 will resume download if the transfer is restarted.*

A restart costs nothing. Everything on disk is kept, and it re-signs the
googlevideo URLs, which expire anyway (`expire=` in the query is a few hours
out).

Worth checking when this happens often: whether the connection is leaving over
IPv6. The `ip=` field in the failing URL is the address YouTube saw, and if it
is a v6 address on a tunnel or a VPN, that is the leg that keeps dropping.

## Bot checks

Enough requests from one address and YouTube answers `HTTP 429` and
`Sign in to confirm you're not a bot`, at which point extraction fails before
any download starts. It clears on its own, in minutes to hours. A VPN whose
exit address is not rate-limited also clears it immediately — and on one
measured evening, moving to a clean route was the difference between 0.67 and
7.7 MiB/s on the same line with the same code.

## A missing fragment is worse than a failure

yt-dlp's default is to skip a fragment it cannot fetch and carry on. These
fragments are byte ranges of one continuous mp4, appended in order, so a
skipped one does not leave a gap in the video: every byte after it lands at the
wrong offset and the file is broken from there to the end, while still arriving
looking like a finished download. `skip_unavailable_fragments` is therefore off
— the download aborts instead, and the pieces already on disk are kept so
running it again resumes.

Worth checking after a long download: the stream file should be exactly the
size the header promised.
